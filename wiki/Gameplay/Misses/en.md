# Misses

Misses in osu! refer to notes that has either been pressed too early or too late. Missing a note will result in the user losing their combo, and losing the chance of getting an S rank for the rest of that play reguardless of the ending accuracy. Slider breaks are different to misses as they do not prevent the user from getting an S rank in that play, if the sudden death or perfect mod is enabled a miss will cause an instant fail.

A miss will be represented by a by a red X appearing in the note's location,<!-- TODO: add image of a "miss" --> followed with an audible sound if the user has over 20 combo.
