# Keyboard

A **keyboard** is the most common input device used to play osu!. By default, the `Z` and `X` keys are set for clicking, but they can be changed to any keys of your choice in the osu! options. In osu!mania, the keyboard is the main input device used since up to 8 keys will need to be used in certain beatmaps on osu!mania.

## Keypad

A **keypad** is a miniature keyboard with a limited set of keys. Keypads are popular in osu! because of their small size and amount of keys, usually 2 or 4.
